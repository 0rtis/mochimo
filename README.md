Update: Code version 2.0 is live and contains critical updates to multiple Mochimo subsystems.  v2.0 is the first, last and only forced hard fork of the Mochimo protocols.  As of block 17185 (0x4321) no other code version will function on the network.  Please do not run previous versions of the code.

See CHANGES.TXT for an overview of the changes.

Of special importance is the release of our v2.0 code under the new MPL2.0 derivative Open Source license.  The community is now free to develop and change the code with the caveat that any changes must be for the benefit of the Mochimo cryptocurrency network, and with a number of exclusions.  Please read LICENSE.PDF for more details on limitations and restrictions.

Note: The license to operate versions of the code prior to v2.0 expires on December 31st, 2018.  Use of the old code after 12/31/18 is strictly prohibited.

Mochimo Project - Main Net Development Repository

SUMMARY: The Mochimo Crypto Engine Main Net code is a fully functional crypto currency network node with text-based wallet included.

RECOMMENDED HARDWARE/SOFTWARE: The included code is designed to be run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-Bit Desktop, with at least 2 processor threads and 2GB of RAM.  At present the code is designed to function on NVIDIA GPUs, and so both gcc and nvcc installations are required.

INSTRUCTIONS: Basic usage instructions for compiling can be found in the mochi directory included in the package.  The code will compile without issue on most Linux-based gcc compatible machines with a 64-bit long.  However please be aware that developer support for troubleshooting will be restricted to those users running the recommended configuration. 

You must read and agree to the LICENSE.PDF file prior to running our code.
